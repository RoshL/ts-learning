// Using Watch Mode -->

// Let's get rid of having to rerun command 'tsc .\app.ts' mannualy, after every code change we do.
// We need to tell TypeScript to watch a file, so that the file will be recompiled whenever that file changes.
// Command to turn "watch mode" on ----> tsc app.ts --watch / tsc app.ts -w
console.log("You can change this string to check watch mode recompillation..");

// Compilling the Entire Project / Multiple Files -->

// What if we have more than one TypeScript file to compile ❔
